        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
            The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to
            external servers. No analytics, tracking, advertising, or third-party
            services are used.
        </p>

        <h2>Location Data</h2>
        <p>
            If enabled by the user, the extension may access approximate location data
            (latitude and longitude) using the browser’s built-in location services.
            Location data is used only locally to calculate sunrise and sunset times.
            Location information is not stored permanently, not shared, and never
            transmitted outside the user’s device.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Any preferences (such as last used location or visual settings) are stored
            locally in the browser using standard web storage. This data remains on the
            user’s device and can be cleared at any time by removing the extension or
            clearing browser data.
        </p>

        <h2>Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            This extension does not share data with third parties. No external APIs are
            contacted except for publicly available sunrise/sunset calculations, when
            applicable.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>

            developer at
